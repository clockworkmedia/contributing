# Contributing

## Branches

Before working on a new task, a bug or a cool new feature, create a new branch. 
Yes, this is called "topic branching", and it's a **thing** at Clockwork. 
Branching basically creates a copy of the branch you wish to update.
It provides code isolation and keep us from breaking things, and NOBODY, I repeat, 
NOBODY likes to work on a broken thing. Topic branching provides better traceability
and makes code much easier to review.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should give a detailed description about changes you've pushed to a repository. 
Once a pull request is sent, and you've just managed to escape Hound comments on style violations by a thread, 
the team will review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

## The Process

Below is an example of an employee of the month contributor.

- Clone the project
- Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch
- Branch for each separate piece of work.
- Do the work, write good commit messages, and read the CONTRIBUTING file if there is one.
- Push to your origin repository.
- Create a new PR in GitHub.
- Respond to any code review feedback.

If any of the above concepts are new to you, refer to the [Github](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/) documentation.
