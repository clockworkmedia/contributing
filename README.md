## Branches

Before working on a new task, bug or a cool new feature, please do so on a new branch. 
**Topic Branching** is not just a **thing** at Clockwork. This way of working 
provides better code isolation and keep us from breaking things. NOBODY, I repeat, 
NOBODY likes to work on a broken thing.
Topic branching also provides better traceability and makes our code much easier to review.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should give a semi-detailed description of the changes you've pushed to a repository. 
Once a pull request is sent, the team will review your set of changes, 
discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.
We encourage everyone to review and make suggestions to better the quality and standards of our work.

## The Process

- Create a project (If new project)
- Clone the project
- Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch
- Branch for each separate piece of work
- Do the work, write good commit messages
- Push to origin repository
- Create a pull request
- Respond to any code review feedback
- Repeat until code is awesome

If any of the above concepts are new to you, refer to the [Github](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/) documentation.
