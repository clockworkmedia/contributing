# Contributing

## Branches

Before working on a new task, a bug or a cool new feature, create a new branch. 
Yes, this is called "topic branching", and it's a **thing** at Clockwork. 
Branching basically creates a copy of the branch you wish to update.
It provides code isolation and keep us from breaking things, and NOBODY, I repeat, 
NOBODY likes to work on a broken thing. Topic branching provides better traceability
and makes code much easier to review.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should give a detailed description about changes you've pushed to a repository. 
Once a pull request is sent, and you've just managed to escape Hound comments on style violations by a thread, 
the team will review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

## The Process

Below is an example of an employee of the month contributor.
